'''
    Logic.py file has the main Business logic of IBFS functions and transporation function.

    IBFS functions are Row Minima method, North-West corner rule and Least Cost method.
    Transportation method used is MODI method.

    Row Minima method:
        In the row minima method, the first row that is the lowest cost cell is exhausted. 
        Our aim will be to allocate the maximum either at the first source or demand at the destinations or to satisfy both. 
        This process must be continued for all the other reduced transportation costs until and unless the supply and demand are satisfied.

    North-West corner rule:
        The name North-west corner is given to this method because the basic variables are selected from the extreme left corner.

    Least Cost method:
        Here, the allocation begins with the cell which has the minimum cost. 
        The lower cost cells are chosen over the higher-cost cell with the objective to have the least cost of transportation.
    
    Transportation Problem: MODI Method:
        There are two phases to solve the transportation problem. 
        In the first phase, the initial basic feasible solution has to be found.
        The second phase involves optimization of the initial basic feasible solution that was obtained in the first phase.
